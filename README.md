### **Project Description**

A revolutionary web app that gives *therapy* to… bullock carts. Yes, the wooden, wheel-y legends of yesteryear. Using highly advanced emotional algorithms (a.k.a. vibes), we diagnose the unspoken trauma these noble carts carry — from overworked spokes to tragic pothole incidents — and help them heal… one *virtual counselling session* at a time.

---

### **The Problem (that doesn’t exist)**

Every day, thousands of bullock carts silently suffer. They endure potholes, bad roads, and the crushing emotional weight of being replaced by motorbikes. No one listens to their problems… until now.

---

### **The Solution (that nobody asked for)**

We created **CartTrauma™**, an AI-powered, animation-enhanced therapy space where carts can share their deepest wheel-feelings, track their “healing level,” get horoscope predictions for their next ride, and even receive a *Healing Certificate*. It’s like Dr. Phil meets National Geographic… but for carts.
